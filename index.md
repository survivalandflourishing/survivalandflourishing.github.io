### About Us 

Survivalandflourishing.fund is a "virtual fund": we organize application submission and evaluation processes to help donors decide where to make donations.  Our goal is to bring financial support to organizations working to improve humanityâ€™s long-term prospects for survival and flourishing.  We use this website to host announcements about our plans to investigate grant-making opportunities.  

SFF was initially funded in 2019 by a grant of approximately $2 million from the Organizational Grants Program of the Berkeley Existential Risk Initiative (BERI), which in turn was funded by donations from philanthropist Jaan Tallinn.  We previously maintained a DAF at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation under the same name (SFF), but that DAF is not currently in active use for our grant-making process.

SFF works closely with [Survival and Flourishing](http://survivalandflourishing.org/) (SAF), a Sponsored Project of [Social and Environmental Entrepreneurs](http://saveourplanet.org/) with a similar mission and overlapping leadership.  While there is no formal relationship between SAF and SFF, we have complementary functions:
- SFF as a general rule does not facilitate grants to individuals, while SAF does.
- SAF as a general rule does not facilitate grants to 501(c)(3) public charities, while SFF does.
